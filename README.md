# Background: #
The Arabic language features dialects with very significant differences in both grammar
and vocabulary, some of which are mutually unintelligible. Unfortunately, most online
resources only contain information on so called "Standard" Arabic (فصحى) and do not reflect
the way that Arabs actually speak.

# About: #
An Arabic Dialect Dictionary created using Django. Any user can search for Arabic to English or English to Arabic definitions and see results in Levantine, Gulf, or Egyptian. Only users with registered accounts can add entries, but they can only add entries for dialects of which they are native speakers. All users can comment on entries. Crowdsourcing
vocabulary is the best way to capture these living dialects.
